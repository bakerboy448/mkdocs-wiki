# Notifiarr Client Reverse Proxy

!!! danger
    None of this is required or necessary. **We recommend NOT exposing your
    Notifiarr client to the Internet at all. In other words, don't do any of this.**
    But you can if you want to access your local Notifiarr Client from the Internet.

While you can certainly poke a hole your firewall and send the traffic directly to this app,
it is recommended that you put it behind a reverse proxy if you're going to expose it. It's pretty easy.

- You'll want to tune the `upstreams` and `urlbase` client settings for your environment.
  - If your reverse proxy IP is `192.168.3.45` then set `upstreams`
    in the Trust Profile page of the local Notifiarr Client to `192.168.3.45/32`
  - You can also set this with the `DN_UPSTREAMS_0` environment variable.
- The `urlbase` on the local Notifiarr client configuration page can be left at `/`,
  but change it if you serve this app from a subfolder like `/notifiarr`.
  - You can also set this with the `DN_URLBASE` environment variable.

!!! info "WebSocket Support"
    The Notifiarr client Web UI uses WebSocket connections. Your reverse proxy configuration
    must include the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers for the UI to function correctly.
    The examples below include these headers.

!!! warning "API Path"
    The `/api` path must not be protected by external authentication (Authelia, Organizr, LDAP, etc.).
    It uses API key authentication handled by the client. If you protect it, integrations from
    notifiarr.com will fail. The examples below handle this correctly.

## Cloudflare Users

If you use Cloudflare Firewall or ZeroTrust see
[the CloudFlare Proxy page](../../pages/client/cloudflare.md)
to ensure Notifiarr is allowed through Cloudflare.

## NGINX Subfolder Example

- We'll assume you want to serve the client from `/notifiarr` and it's running on `127.0.0.1`.
- Here's a sample nginx config to do that:

```nginx
# Notifiarr Client
location /notifiarr/api {
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    set $notifiarr http://127.0.0.1:5454;
    proxy_pass $notifiarr$request_uri;
    auth_request off;
}

location /notifiarr {
    # <put proxy auth directives here> Optional:
    # proxy_set_header X-WebAuth-User $auth_user;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    set $notifiarr http://127.0.0.1:5454;
    proxy_pass $notifiarr$request_uri;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection $http_connection;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

Make sure the Nginx `location` path matches the `URL Base` Notifiarr setting.
That's all there is to it.

## Reverse Proxy Authentication

!!! info
    If using Authelia or Organizr ensure they are passing the username header.

There is working a SWAG example (with authelia, organizr, ldap) at the bottom of this page.

For example in NGINX: if `auth_user` is the variable your authentication app is passing (and it probably isn't) then your would need:

```nginx
proxy_set_header X-WebAuth-User $auth_user;
```

## Traefik

Make sure to select the correct `Remote-User` header on the Trust Profile page in the client's Web UI.

## NGINX Subdomain Example

- We'll assume you're running LSIO's SWAG [docker container](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag)
- Non-SWAG users will need to update the file - including the `includes` as applicable

    }

```

## Nginx Proxy Manager

- You will need a registered domain name with ddns services.
- Add a subdomain thru aliases on your domain/ddns provider and point it to your external ip.
- Add a proxy host in NPM.

### Details Tab

1. Domain names: subdomain you just created
1. Scheme: `http`
1. Forwarded Hostname/IP: Your Internal LAN IP hosting Notifiarr E.g. `192.168.1.2`
1. Forward Port : The port Notifiarr is running on, default: `5454`
1. Check `Block common exploits`

### SSL Tab

1. Choose a certificate ( or make a fresh one pointing to your freshly made subdomain )
1. Check `Force SSL and HTTP/2 Support`
1. Save

You will need to use Notifiarr Login/Password setup, not the webauth method with the above NPM configuration.
