# Notifiarr Client Cloudflare Proxy

!!! danger
    None of this is required or necessary. **We recommend NOT exposing your
    Notifiarr client to the Internet at all. In other words, don't do any of this.**
    But you can if you want to access your local Notifiarr Client from the Internet.

Some users use Cloudflare's "Cloudflare Tunnel" feature or additional Cloudflare security
features to provide protected external access to their Notifiarr Client and other services.
Specific configuration required for Cloudflare's various options are detailed below.

## Cloudflare Tunnel

!!! info
    This assumes that you already have a Cloudflare Tunnel set up on your system.
    If you want to get started with Cloudflare Tunnels follow this YouTube guide first:

1. Login to your Cloudflare teams account at [dash.teams.Cloudflare.com](https://dash.teams.Cloudflare.com/)
1. Click **Tunnels** and then **configure** next to the Cloudflare Tunnel you would like to use.

1. Fill in the public hostname information on the next screen.

    1. `Subdomain`: Notifiarr (or whatever else you want it to be)
    1. `Domain`: choose one of your domains
    1. `Service`: HTTP + Your Local IP Address for Notifiarr

Save your host name settings, that's it! Your client is now exposed to the Internet!

## Cloudflare WAF / ZeroTrust

If you use Cloudflare WAF rules or ZeroTrust to protect your Notifiarr client, you must
ensure that the Notifiarr.com website can still communicate with the client's `/api` path.

The client communicates with `https://notifiarr.com` and the website communicates back
through the Site Tunnel (websocket). If you expose your client directly through Cloudflare
and have WAF or ZeroTrust rules, create a bypass rule or application policy that allows
requests from the Notifiarr.com servers to reach the `/api` path on your client's domain.

!!! tip "Site Tunnel"
    The recommended approach is to use the built-in **Site Tunnel** feature instead of
    exposing the client to the Internet. The Site Tunnel creates a persistent websocket
    connection from the client to notifiarr.com, so no inbound port or firewall rules
    are needed. Configure this on the *Settings => Site Tunnel* page in the client Web UI.
