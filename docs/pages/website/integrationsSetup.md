1. Once you open the `Integration Configuration` you only need to toggle on/off what you want to use.

## View Modes

The integrations page supports two layout modes:

- **Card View** - Displays each integration as a card with a summary, settings cog, and reload button
- **List View** - Displays integrations in a sidebar list; select one to view its settings in the main area

Toggle between views using the icons in the top right corner of the page.

## Integration Configuration Card

The first card on the page shows:

- `Active` / `Inactive` / `Total` - Counts of your enabled vs. available integrations
- `Daily overview` - Select a Discord channel to receive a daily summary of notifications sent per integration (sent around 11:50 PM)
- `DND` (Do Not Disturb) - Configure time windows to stop notifications for specific integrations

## Reactions Setup

- You can use any emoji you prefer for reactions, however, if you would like to use the existing set of emoji provided by Notifiarr, visit [notifiarr-reactions](https://notifiarr.com/user.php?page=setup&grab=reactions) and save the .zip file.

- After extracting the contents of the zip file, you can choose which emoji you would like to use by uploading them to your Discord server.

- For instructions on uploading emoji to your server, please visit this article from Discord: [discord-custom-emoji](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis)

- Once you've uploaded the emoji you want to use, you will need to find the emoji's ID for your server.  To do this:
  
1. Go to any channel on your server and type `\:emoji_name:` (replace `emoji_name` with the actual name/alias you are using for the emoji when you uploaded it to your server) then press Enter.

2. You will see a message in your chat that looks like `<:emoji_name:1069872535814496896>`. In this example, `emoji_name` represents the name/alias of the emoji, and the string of numbers after the colon is the emoji ID.

- Copy this value, without the brackets or leading colon (in this example, you would copy `emoji_name:1069872535814496896`) and paste the results in the Discord settings field that corresponds to the reaction you are using the emoji for.

## Discord Server Missing from Dropdown

- This should only be an issue if you linked your Discord account to Notifiarr before creating the server.
- If you created the server after you already authorized your account, give it 5 minutes and re-authorize so it re-fetches the server list.
