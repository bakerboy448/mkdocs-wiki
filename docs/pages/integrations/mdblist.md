# MDBList

## What is MDBList

MDBList is a 3rd party service that allows you to curate lists of shows and movies from various sources and [can be found here](https://mdblist.com), this integration is meant to do three things:

1. Allow for the ability to add individual shows or movies to Radarr or Sonarr using the add button on the show item on the MDBList website
2. Sync lists created on MDBList into Sonarr and Radarr automatically
3. Sync a list of IDs from your local collection to MDBList which can be used within the filtering of a list, to exclude, for example, all collected shows or movies

## Prerequisites

1. Notifiarr setup and working with Discord, Sonarr, and Radarr integrations
2. Account with MDBList
3. API key created on the Notifiarr website and assigned for use with MDBList, this can be generated and found in your profile, under the API Keys section
4. Notifiarr API key allocated to the MDBList integration added to your profile under preferences\Notifiarr on MDBList and enable “Automatically add lists to Radarr (if configured in Notifiarr)”

## Trigger options

- `List Add` - Receive a notification when MDBList sends a new list to add to the starr apps
- `List Update` - Receive a notification when MDBList sends an updated list to add to the starr apps
- `Movie Add` - Receive a notification when a movie is added from the MDBList website
- `Show Add` - Receive a notification when a show is added from the MDBList website

Each trigger has notification color and notification ping settings.

## Steps to configure integration

1. From within the Notifiarr website add the MDBList integration
2. Configure your Discord channels
3. Enable the triggers you want (e.g. `Movie Add` and `Show Add`) by enabling the toggles as shown below.

We now need to configure some additional settings from within the integration, to tell Notifiarr what settings to use when adding a movie or show.

## Configuration

!!! note
    Currently you cannot send things (movies, shows, lists) to different instances and you cannot have different settings per instance. This is a limitation on the side of MDBList.
