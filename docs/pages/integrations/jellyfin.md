### NOTIFIARR

1. This needs to be done in Jellyfin before webhooks can be used
1. After the webhook plugin is installed, this is how you add the webhook for Notifiarr

### JELLYFIN

To configure your Jellyfin server to work with Notifiarr, we will first have to configure a few things, such as our webhook and notification settings - the latter required to for new content notifications.

## Install the Webhook Plugin

To install the Webhook plugin, navigate to the `Dashboard` and into the `Plugins` section.
From here, scroll down until you find the `Webhook Plugin`

Click on the plugin and install the latest version.
Once installed, go ahead and restart your Jellyfin server for the plugin to be loaded.

## Configure the Webhook Plugin

Once you have restarted your Jellyfin server, navigate back to your `Plugins` menu and look for **Webhook** under the `My Plugins tab`. Click on it to reveal its options.

Write the URL of your Jellyfin server where it says `SERVER URL` and click on **"Add Generic Destination"** and scroll down to configure it.

- `NAME`

Give the Webhook a name

!!! info
     Example: Notifiarr

- `Webhook Url`

!!! note
     This is the URL of your webhook, which includes your API Key

     ```bash
     https://notifiarr.com/api/v1/notification/jellyfin/YOUR_API_KEY
     ```

- `Notification Type`

Enable all **except**:

1. Generic
1. Playback Progress
1. Task Completed
1. User Data Saved

Check **"Send All Properties (ignores template)"**

Once the webhook has been configured, remember to click on  **Save**.

!!! note
     If you are using the 'Item Added' notification, be sure to enable it in the notifications settings, otherwise it won't work.
     <kbd>Dashboard > Notifications > New content added</kbd>
     You can also change how often Jellyfin notifies you of new items by changing the intervals of the scheduled task.
     <kbd>Dashboard > Scheduled Tasks > Webhook Item Added Notifier</kbd>

## Debugging Webhooks

---

!!! info
     If your webhook isn't working, start debugging by adding webhooks to your logging configuration.
     Amend your Jellyfin's <kbd>logging.json</kbd> file to enable webhook debugging by adding `"Jellyfin.Plugin.Webhook": "Debug"`

!!! warning
     Remember to add a comma after `"System": "Warning"` to avoid formatting errors.
     ```diff
     {
     "Serilog": {
          "MinimumLevel": {
               "Default": "Information",
               "Override": {
                    "Microsoft": "Warning",
                    "System": "Warning",
     +               "Jellyfin.Plugin.Webhook": "Debug"
               }
          }
     ```
