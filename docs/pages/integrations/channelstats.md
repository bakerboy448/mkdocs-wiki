# Channel stats

!!! Prerequisites
    This integration requires both a [client](https://notifiarr.wiki/pages/client/install/) setup and the configuration of the [dashboard](https://notifiarr.wiki/pages/integrations/dashboard/) integration, as the channel stats will pull data from there.

!!! info
    `Channel stats` requires you to enable the `manage roles` and `connect` permissions within your discord settings for the notifiarr bot.

!!! warning
    Do not attempt to change any of the permissions or settings of the channels that are created by this integration. They are very specific, so they are read-only to users.

## Setup

Setup for `channel stats` is a little different than the rest; you don't need an API key, nor do you choose any channels. Since we have to give the bot the above permissions, it instead creates voice channels with the appropriate data that you enable.

While most of the information is pulled from the dashboard integration, things such as `New Movies` or `New Episodes` utilize the `Imported` trigger for the corresponding Starr integration. If you plan to use the github triggers, you will need to also setup the github integration.

!!! info
    You will also need the Plex client setup if you plan to use the available Plex triggers.

Each stat creates a Discord voice channel displaying the corresponding value. You can customize the display name for each stat.
